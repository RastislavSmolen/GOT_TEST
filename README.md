# GOT_TEST
I have tryed to do everything on the list. 
But the API especialy of the characters are very broken, there are more missing character with no names that actual characters.So I had skipp this. I would go to back end developer and asked what is going on.
Search feature very small and simple solution as I like to follow MVP(minimum viable product). And scale the solution as is needed. 
# What I would change.


I went with simple solution MVVM and one unit test to prove testability of the code, it is self explanatory. 
If this was a real project. I would go with testing every API call book/characters/houses. 
I have tried to keep it nice and simple and light. I went with generics so we dont care what kind of data we are parsing. 
I would have implemented linting for clean code. For more complicated app I would have implemented MVVM with coordinator for separation.
Depending on needs of the the project I would go with .xib as storyboard can get slow with multiple screens.
In the future I would create utitlities folder for scalable ui that are used across the app to make it quick to reuse and implement.
